            <h3>Serving West Michigan since 1973</h3>

            <div id="about" class="section">
                <h2>About</h2>

                <p>Who says that "watching paint dry" is not exciting? I think it is. Really! I have been painting
                    professionally for more than forty years in homes, estates, bungalows, cottages, businesses,
                    condos and just about every other place in West Michigan you can imagine. No job is too big...or
                    too small.

                <p>My clients will tell you that I'm prompt, careful, conscientious, detail-oriented and thorough.
                    Whenever you need any services related to the walls of your home or business, I hope you'll get
                    in touch with me. It would be my pleasure to help you finish, refinish or renew your space.
